To run the program you must maintain the /res folder along with the executable.

You will also need a copy of glew32.dll and SDL2.dll!!!

The game will probably run on your machine, because if you followed the project's main README configuration these .dlls are probably on your PATH!
But to ensure it will run on other people's machines you will need to obtain and ship a copy of them!

Follow these links to do that:
- glew32: http://glew.sourceforge.net/
- SDL2: https://www.libsdl.org/
